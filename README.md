# 🦠 COVID-19 Case Study Project

This project was divided into **two main phases**:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Google Colab  
2. **Interactive Dashboard Development** using Streamlit

## 📊 Phase 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Google Colab) [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12UPktd9TejAHb-mAaV_UNrnkQz8sUD-C/view?usp=sharing]

Performed in-depth analysis on global COVID-19 datasets to understand the spread and progression of the pandemic.

### 🔍 Key Tasks:
- Merged datasets (confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries) into a unified time-series format.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data to handle missing values and anomalies.
- Computed monthly and daily aggregates per country.
- Analysed recovery and death rates, and visualised waves of infection.
- Created visualisations using `matplotlib` and `plotly` to show:
  - Daily/Monthly new cases
  - Recovery vs Death comparison
  - Top 25 countries per metric

## 📈 Phase 2 – Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit) [https://covid19casestudy-ehupdbjzqwngbmvjpyw8bu.streamlit.app/]

Developed a responsive and interactive COVID-19 dashboard to make the insights more accessible and user-friendly.

### 🛠️ Features:
- Country-wise statistics for Confirmed, Deaths, and Recoveries.
- Monthly summary charts for the top 25 affected countries.
- Line and stacked bar charts using `plotly`.
- Metric selector and interactive components.
- Display of pandemic waves and trend breakdowns.
